# Memories of Devolution Y

**What's the purpose of this repository?**

Akito Mizukito: I wanted to do a kang, a kang that no one in the community has ever done before.

**How do we (the community) participate?**

It's quite simple!

You create a folder in /KeepDevolving and name it using your GitHub username!

For example, KeepDevolving/RealAkito

Then create a file called KeepDevolving.ext (By .ext it can be .txt, .py, .sh, .go, js and much more!) then type KeepEvolving in your countries' language!

~~ Example ~~
KeepDevolving.txt
`進化し続ける - With love from Tokyo, Japan`

(You can make more than one KeepDevolving file, e.g. in python as KeepDevolving.py)
